            <h3>Certain Risk Factors Relating to Purchase, Sale, and Use of Ingame items, assets and DW Tokens with the early access</h3>
            IMPORTANT NOTE: FUTURESHOCK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM: RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE GAME - AND/OR ANY ERROR, OMISSION
            OR INACCURACY IN ANY SUCH INFORMATION - AND/OR ANY ACTION RESULTING FROM SUCH INFORMATION.
            <ul class="help">
                <h4>By purchasing, owning, and using any assets, items, or DW Tokens, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks: </h4>
                <h5>1. General Suitability of Token Purchase </h5>
                <li>The purchase of DW Tokens from FUTURESHOCK is only suitable for financially sophisticated persons who are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such a purchase, or other persons who have been professionally advised with regard to token
                    purchase, and who have sufficient financial resources to be able to bear any losses that may arise therefrom (which may be equal to the whole amount spent in connection with the token purchase). Such a purchase should not be seen as an
                    investment or a financial asset. </li>
    
                <h5>2. Risk of Losing Access to DW Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s)</h5>
                <li>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of DW Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing DW
                    Tokens will result in loss of such DW Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your
                    DW Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store DW Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also
                    result in the loss of you DW Tokens.</li>
                <h5>3. Risks Associated with the Steem Protocol </h5>
                <li>Because DW Tokens and Drugwars are based on the Steem protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Steem protocol may have a material adverse effect on Drugwars or DW Tokens. </li>
                <h5>4. Risk of Mining Attacks </h5>
                <li> As with other decentralized cryptographic DW Tokens based on the Steem protocol, the DW Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Token transactions on the Steem blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend
                    attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to Drugwars and the DW Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving DW Tokens.
                    </li>
                <h5>5. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</h5>
                <li> Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Drugwars or the DW Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks,
                    smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because Drugwars is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of FUTURESHOCK team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure
                    of Drugwars, which could negatively affect Drugwars and the DW Tokens, including the utility of the DW Tokens for obtaining Services.
                    <li>Hackers or other malicious groups of organizations may also attempt to get access to private keys or other access credentials in the Wallet or any other wallet, vault, or other storage mechanism used to receive and hold DW Tokens. As
                        the result, the DW Tokens may be lost forever. </li>
                    <h5>6. Risk of buying ingame assets, items and resources.</h5>
                    <li> We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any components of the game, items, assets and/or wipe cheaters account without any liability to you at any time. Hackers or other malicious groups of organizations may also attempt
                        to get access to private keys or other access credentials in the Wallet or any other wallet, vault, or other storage mechanism used to receive and hold DW Tokens. As the result, the DW Tokens may be lost forever. </li>
                    <h5>7. Risks Associated with Markets for DW Tokens </h5>
                    <li>The DW Tokens are intended to be used solely within Drugwars and FUTURESHOCK accredited apps, and FUTURESHOCK will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of DW Tokens. This restricts the contemplated
                        avenues for using DW Tokens to the provision or receipt of Services, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to the DW Tokens you own. Even if secondary trading of DW Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges,
                        such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to DW
                        Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. </li>
                    <h5>8. Risk of Uninsured Losses </h5>
                    <li> Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, DW Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer,
                        such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer recourse to you.
                    </li>
                    <h5>9. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions </h5>
                    <li>The regulatory status of the DW Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology
                        and its applications, including Drugwars and the DW Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology
                        and its applications, including Drugwars and the DW Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Drugwars and the DW Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase,
                        sale and delivery of the DW Tokens constitutes unlawful activity or that the DW Tokens are a regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase,
                        sale and delivery thereof. FUTURESHOCK may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain
                        the necessary regulatory approva the DW Tokens for obtaining Services.
                    </li>
                    <h5>10. Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of Drugwars </h5>
                    <li>Drugwars is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although FUTURESHOCK intends for the DW Tokens and DrugWars to function as described here, and intends to take commercially reasonable steps toward those
                        ends, FUTURESHOCK may have to make changes to the specifications of the DW Tokens or Platform for any number of legitimate reasons. Moreover, FUTURESHOCK has no control over how other participants will use Drugwars, what products or services
                        will be offered through Drugwars by third parties, or how third-party products and services will utilize DW Tokens (if at all). This could create the risk that the DW Tokens or Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not
                        meet your expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite FUTURESHOCKâ€™s good faith efforts to develop and participate in Drugwars, it is still possible that Drugwars will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately
                        developed or maintained, which may negatively impact Drugwars and DW Tokens, and the potential utility of the DW Tokens, including the utility of the DW Tokens for obtaining Services.
                    </li>
                    <h5>11. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of BTC or STEEM Value </h5>
                    <li> If the value of BTC or STEEM or other coins fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Token sale, FUTURESHOCK team may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain Drugwars in the manner that it intended. In
                        addition to the usual market forces, there are several potential events which could exacerbate the risk of unfavorable fluctuation in the value of BTC or STEEM or other coins, including attack on different network, or significant security
                        incidents or market irregularities at one or more of the major cryptocurrency exchanges.
                    </li>
                    <h5>12. Risk of Dissolution of FUTURESHOCK or Platform </h5>
                    <li>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of BTC or STEEM (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the DW Tokensâ€™ utility (including their
                        utility for obtaining Services), the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, Drugwars may no longer be viable to operate or FUTURESHOCK may dissolve.
                    </li>
                    <h5>13. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights </h5>
                    <li>Because DW Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to Drugwars or FUTURESHOCK, all decisions involving FUTURESHOCKâ€™s products or services within Drugwars or FUTURESHOCK itself will be made by FUTURESHOCK at its sole discretion,
                        including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue its products or services in Drugwars, to create and sell more DW Tokens for use in Drugwars, or to sell or liquidate FUTURESHOCK. These decisions could adversely affect Drugwars
                        and the utility of any DW Tokens you own, including their utility for obtaining Services.
                    </li>
                    <h5>14. Regulatory Risks </h5>
                    <li>FUTURESHOCK, and by extension Drugwars, is subject to a variety of European laws and regulations, including those with respect to privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and regulations, and
                        the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting Drugwars could be enacted, which could impact the utility of the DW Tokens in Drugwars. Additionally, Drugwars
                        participants are subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws
                        and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact Drugwars and the DW Tokens, including the DW Tokensâ€™ utility for obtaining Services. Also, changes in laws or regulations
                        governing FUTURESHOCK's operations may adversely affect its business. Any change in FUTURESHOCK's tax status, or in taxation legislation in the United States or elsewhere, could affect the value of its financial holdings, its business and
                        FUTURESHOCK's ability to achieve its business objective. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisers with respect to their particular tax situations and the tax effects of the purchase of DW Tokens from FUTURESHOCK.
                    </li>
                    <h5>15. Operational Risks </h5>
                    <li>FUTURESHOCK is a young company and the growth of the team and its capabilities may take longer than expected to result in the intended usefulness for the DW Tokens. The DW Tokens are just one product in a highly competitive market, and
                        broad adoption by other users and developments by technology partners may take longer than expected. The usefulness of the DW Tokens depends on the extent of widespread adoption of the offered technology by the marketplace.
                    </li>
                    <h5>16. Risk of Lack of Adoption </h5>
                    <li>The success of Drugwars, Services, and DW Tokens is dependent in large part to the adoption of Drugwars, Services, and underlying technology by users. It is possible that users do not adopt or use Drugwars. Such lack of use or interest
                        could negatively impact the development of Drugwars and therefore the potential utility of the DW Tokens, including the utility of the DW Tokens for obtaining Services.
                    </li>
                    <h5>17. Technology Risks </h5>
                    <li>The DW Tokens are intended to represent a new capability on emerging technology that is not fully proven in use. As the technology matures, new capabilities may dramatically alter the usefulness of the DW Tokens or the ability to use
                        or sell them. The functionality of the DW Tokens is complex, will require enhancements and product support over time, and full functionality may take longer than expected. The full functionality of the DW Tokens is not yet complete
                        and no assurance can be provided of such completion.
                    </li>
                    <h5>18. Unanticipated Risks </h5>
                    <li>Cryptographic DW Tokens such as the DW Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included here, there are other risks associated with your purchase, possession, and use of the DW Tokens, including unanticipated
                        risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this document.
