For example, if there are 2 Bouncers, 2 Big Mammas and 1 Knifer attacking 5 Rowdies and 5 Lawyers, one round will be the attack on Rowdies and another round will be the attack on Lawyers. All Bouncers, Big Mammas and Knifer will attack Rowdies and assign damage, Rowdies will give them damage during defense. All Bouncers, Big Mammas and Knifer will attack Lawyers and assign damage, Lawyers will give them damage during defense. If there are units still left alive, the process continues. This, of course, depends on the training of the units too since different training will help units be better at attacking and defending themselves."
